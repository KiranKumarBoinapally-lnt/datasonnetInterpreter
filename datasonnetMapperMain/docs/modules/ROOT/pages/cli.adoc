= Command Line Interface

You'll call the Command Line Interface (CLI) either via a Java Jar or Docker, but the arguments passed will be the same either way.
In this shared documentation, calling the CLI with some arguments will be written `_datasonnet_ -args here`, where `_datasonnet_` stands for either the Jar or Docker calling convention.

== Transforming Data

`_datasonnet_ run mapping.ds input.json`


This passes “input.json” as the payload to the transformation.
Note: it doesn’t matter to the CLI what your filename is, it will pass it to the DataSonnet with the name “payload”.
The output will be printed.

== Validation

`_datasonnet_ validate mapping.ds`

This validates the syntax of your DataSonnet.
Note: it does not validate the logic of the program at all, for example, errors in variable names.

== Help

For more options, including how to pass variables into your DataSonnet, check out the help options with -h.
