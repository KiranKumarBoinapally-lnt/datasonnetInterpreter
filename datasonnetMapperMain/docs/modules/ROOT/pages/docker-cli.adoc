== Obtaining the CLI via Docker

These instructions assume you have Docker installed already.
If you do not, go ahead and do that first.
To find out how to install Docker for your operating system, go to https://docs.docker.com/install/ then click on your operating system in the left-hand menu.

To obtain access to the Docker CLI during our internal release, first contact Kent to gain access to our private docker repository, including configuration instructions.

== Using the CLI via Docker

Once you have access to the private Docker repository, use the docker CLI like the following:

----
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/var/cache/datasonnet 849905330246.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/datasonnet/datasonnet:1.0.1-SNAPSHOT
----

For example, performing a transformation would be

----
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/var/cache/datasonnet 849905330246.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/datasonnet/datasonnet:1.0.1-SNAPSHOT run mapping.ds input.json
----

The command assumes your scripts are all in the current directory or directories below it, and that you use relative paths.
